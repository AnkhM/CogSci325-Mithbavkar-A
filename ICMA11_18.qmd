## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
flights_jan_100 <- flights |> 
  filter(month == 1) |> 
  sample_n(100)
```

```{r}
p <- flights_jan_100 |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = distance, x = air_time)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = str_c("Carrier: ", carrier))) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r}
ggplotly(p)
```
